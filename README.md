**Loreta** (EEG general library) is a pure-[julia](https://julialang.org/) 100%-human package for computing, testing and using human EEG 
(Electroencephalography) inverse solutions of the *Minimum Norm* family. Particularly, it implements the following distributed inverse solutions:
- *weighted minimum norm*,
- *standardized Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography* (sLORETA),
- *exact Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography* (eLORETA).

For all of them, the *model-driven* and the *data-driven* version are provided, with the latter being actually *beamformers* and being little known in the literature.

## 📦 Installation

Execute the following command in julia's REPL:

```julia
]add Loreta
```

There is virtually no requirement for this package. Any Julia version starting at 0.7 would work.

## 🔣 Problem Statement, Notation and Nomenclature

We are given an EEG sensor potentials measurement

x(t) ∈ ℝⁿ 

at n electrodes referenced to the common average, in μV units, where t is time (samples);

we wish to estimate the current density

j(t) ∈ ℝᵖ 

at p cortical grey matter voxels, in A/m² units, in the three Cartesian spatial directions (x, y, z)

We have therefore:

**Forward equation** — determining the scalp voltage given the current distribution:

x(t) = K c(t)

It is unique for a given leadfield matrix 

K ∈ ℝⁿ×³ᵖ, 

which is a physical head model.

**Inverse solution** — estimating the current distribution given the scalp voltage:

j(t) = T x(t)

It is not unique. Each inverse solution method yields a different transfer matrix

T ∈ ℝ³ᵖ×ⁿ

> [!NOTE] 
> A solution is said *genuine* or to *respect the measurement* if K T = I.
> The weighted minimum norm and eLORETA are genuine solutions, while sLORETA is not.

> [!NOTE] 
> Matrix T K ≠ I is called the resolution matrix. Its successive groups of three columns, one group per voxel, are called the point-spread functions. 
> They allow one to ascertain whether the transfer matrix is capable of correctly localizing a single current dipole, regardless of its position (voxel) and orientation.

> This is a minimal localization capability for an inverse solution, as it (unrealistically) assumes the absence of noise in the measurement and the existence of only one active dipole at a time. Nonetheless, it is a minimal requirement. sLORETA and eLORETA possess this property, while the minimum norm does not, like most inverse solution methods found in the literature.



The **distributed EEG inverse problem** is stated as it follows: 

- we are given an EEG sensor potentials measurement \( x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{N} \) at \(N\) electrodes referenced to the common average, in \(\mu\)\(V\) units where \(t\) is time (samples) 
- we wish to estimate the current density \( j(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{Q} \) at \(Q\) cortical grey matter voxels ,in \(A/m²\) units, in the three Cartesian spatial directions \((x, y, z)\). 

We have therefore:

- **Forward equation**, determining the scalp voltage given the current distribution : \(x(t) = K c(t)\)
    It is unique for a given *leadfield matrix* \( K \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times (Q \times 3)} \), which is a physical head model.

- **Inverse solution**, estimating the current distribution given the scalp voltage : \(j(t) = T x(t)\)
    It is not-unique. Each inverse solution method yields a different *tranfer matrix* \( T \in \mathbb{R}^{(Q \times 3) \times N } \).

A solution is said "genuine" or to "respect the measurement" if \(KT=I\). The weighted minimum norm and eLORETA are genuine solutions, while sLORETA is not.

Matrix \(TK \ne I\) is named the *resolution matrix*. Its successive groups of three columns, one for each voxel, are named the *point-spread functions*. They allows to ascertain whether the transfer matrix is capable of localizing correctly a single current dipole, regardless its position (voxel) and orientation. This is a minimal localization capability for an inverse solution, as it (unrealistically) assumes the absence of noise in the measurement and the existence of only one active dipole at a time. Nonetheless, it is a minimal requirement. sLORETA and eLORETA do possess this property, while the minimum norm does not, like most of the inverse solution methods found in the literature.

> [!CAUTION] 
> Throughout this documentation and in the package it is always assumed both the input data and the leadfield matrix is referenced to the common average --- see [centeringMatrix](#centeringmatrix).

#### centeringMatrix

```julia
function centeringMatrix(Ne::Int)
```

The common average reference (CAR) operator for referencing EEG data potentials so that their mean across sensors (space) is zero at all samples.

Let \(X\) be the \(T×N\) EEG recording, where  \(T\) and  \(N\) denote the number of samples and channels (sensors), respectively,
and let  \(H_N\) be the  \(N×N\) centering matrix, then 

\(Y=XH_N\)

is the CAR (or *centered*) data.

\(H_N\) is named the *common average reference operator*. It is given at p.67 by Searle (1982)[^1], as

\(H_N = I_N - \frac{1}{N} \left( \mathbf{1}_N \mathbf{1}_N^\top \right)\)

where \(I_N\) is the N-dimensional identity matrix and \(\mathbf{1}_N\) is the \(N\)-dimensional vector of ones.

**Alias** ℌ (U+0210C, with escape sequence "frakH")

**Return** the \(N×N\) centering matrix.

**See**[`car!`](@ref)

**Examples**
```julia
using Eegle

X = randn(128, 19)

# CAR
X_car = X * centeringMatrix(size(X, 2))
# or
X_car = X * ℌ(size(X, 2))

# double-centered data: zero mean across time and space
X_dc = ℌ(size(X, 1)) * X * ℌ(size(X, 2))
```
